# R-chip8

Another chip 8 emulator.
This is a chip 8 emulator written in Rust. My goal is to learn Rust as well as learn about writing emulators.
I am following the tutorial at [http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/](http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/).

## State

At this time it runs a few demos but is far to be complete. Not fully implemented and buggy.
